# PowerliftingApp Microservices

## Project Overview

**PowerliftingApp** is a microservices-based application for Powerlifting enthusiasts. It consists of three services:

* **Userservice** – manages user registration, authentication, and user data
* **Profileservice** – manages user profiles (avatar, bio, Wilks score)
* **Wilksservice** – calculates Wilks scores for powerlifting performance

The services communicate through **REST API**. The application uses Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Maven, and Docker for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

* Java 17
* Spring Boot 3.3
* Maven
* Spring Security
* Spring Data JPA
* PostgreSQL
* Docker & Docker Compose

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd App
```
2. **Build all services with Maven**
```bash
cd App
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

3. **Build and start services using Docker Compose**
